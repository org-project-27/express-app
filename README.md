## Database Management

This project uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for database management. The following commands help manage the database schema and migrations:

- `db:pull`: Synchronizes your Prisma schema with the database schema.
- `db:deploy`: Applies all pending migrations to the database.
- `db:migrate`: Creates a new migration based on the changes in your Prisma schema and applies it.
- `db:reset`: Resets the database by rolling back and reapplying all migrations.

Ensure you have configured your database connection string in the `.env` file.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and configure the necessary environment variables. For example:

```
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/mydatabase"
JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret"
```
